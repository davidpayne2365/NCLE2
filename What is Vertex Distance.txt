What is Vertex Distance?
Vertex distance is just the space between the glasses lens (phoropter) and your eye, usually about 12 mm (millimeters).

When a patient takes an eye test, their prescription is measured at this distance (12 mm away from the eye). But contact lenses sit directly on the eye, at 0 mm.

Why Does Vertex Distance Matter?
Because glasses lenses are further away from the eye, the same prescription acts differently when put directly onto the eye as a contact lens.

Rule to Remember:

When you move a lens closer to your eye (from glasses → contact lenses), it behaves more plus (or less minus).

That means a lens prescription might need to be slightly changed to achieve the same vision correction.

Simple Example (Without Math):
Imagine the eye doctor gives someone a prescription of -10.00 in glasses.

Glasses lenses sit at 12 mm away.

If we put that same -10.00 lens directly onto the eye (0 mm), it actually feels "stronger" (too much minus).

To correct this, the lens needs to become slightly weaker (less minus), for example around -9.00 to look the same as -10.00 did at 12 mm away.

Simple Math Example (Basic Calculation):
Here's a basic formula explained simply:

Edit
Perceived Power = Original Power ÷ [1 + (vertex distance in meters × Original Power)]
Perceived Power is the prescription needed for the contact lens.

Original Power is the glasses prescription.

Vertex distance is usually 12 mm, which you convert to 0.012 meters (just divide mm by 1000).

Example Math:
Original glasses prescription: -10.00

Vertex distance: 12 mm = 0.012 meters

Plugging into the formula clearly:

= -10 ÷ [1 + (0.012 × -10)]
= -10 ÷ [1 + (-0.12)]
= -10 ÷ 0.88
= -11.36 (actually this would indicate a mistake—let's carefully recheck this!)
Wait, let's carefully fix this because a negative lens getting closer actually becomes less minus (more plus), not more negative. That means we must correctly use the sign inside the formula like this:

The proper formula (careful correction):

Edit
Perceived Power = Original Power ÷ [1 - (vertex distance × Original Power)]
Careful recalculation (this is why we use plus/minus carefully):

Copy
Edit
= -10 ÷ [1 - (0.012 × -10)]
= -10 ÷ [1 + 0.12]
= -10 ÷ 1.12
= -8.93 (rounded)
This shows clearly a -10.00 lens at 12 mm acts like a -8.93 lens at 0 mm (contact lens).

Simple takeaway to memorize:

Around -10.00 glasses becomes around -9.00 contacts (close enough to remember easily).

How About Cylindrical (Astigmatism) Lenses?
Sometimes prescriptions aren't just simple numbers, they have astigmatism. A prescription might look like this:

diff
Copy
Edit
-5.00 -5.00 x 180
This prescription has two parts:

Sphere power (-5.00): overall correction.

Cylinder power (-5.00): additional correction for astigmatism at a certain angle (axis).

How to Solve Vertex Distance with Cylinders (Simple Steps):
Break down the prescription into two separate meridians (directions): one at the axis listed (180°) and one 90 degrees away (90°).

Calculate vertex distance separately for each direction.

Using the example above clearly:

At 180°, the power is -5.00.

At -5.00, vertex distance changes about 0.25 diopters (simple rule: at about -5.00 power, you change by about a quarter diopter). So, -5.00 becomes -4.75 in contacts.

To find the power at the opposite direction (90°), combine the sphere and cylinder powers:

Sphere: -5.00, Cylinder: -5.00

Total power at opposite direction (90°) = -10.00 (-5 sphere + -5 cylinder = -10 total).

At -10.00, vertex distance changes about 1.00 diopter, so -10.00 becomes about -9.00 in contacts.

After you've recalculated these two numbers, rewrite the prescription clearly:

First write the less minus (most plus) number: -4.75

Then ask: how far is it from -4.75 to -9.00? That's a difference of -4.25 diopters.

The cylinder becomes: -4.25, keeping the same axis (180°).

Final adjusted contact lens prescription:

Edit
-4.75 -4.25 x 180
Easy Tips to Memorize for the Exam:
-10.00 glasses → -9.00 contacts (approximately, easy to remember).

-5.00 glasses → -4.75 contacts (small 0.25 difference).

Any minus lens always becomes less minus (more plus) when moving from glasses to contacts.

Super Simple Recap:
Vertex distance: gap between eye and lens (12 mm usually).

Closer lens (contacts): becomes less minus, more plus.

Farther lens: opposite (more minus, less plus).

Simple formula available, but memorize examples above for quick answers.

For astigmatism, calculate each direction separately, then recombine.

That’s it!
