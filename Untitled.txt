
Step 1: Changing (Transposing) Prescriptions
Eye prescriptions come in two forms:

Minus Cylinder Form (the one we want for contact lenses)

Plus Cylinder Form (we must convert this)

Why transpose?
Contact lens prescriptions always use minus cylinder form.

Example of transposing:
Original prescription:

diff
Copy
Edit
-2.50 +1.00 x180
This is "plus cylinder" because the cylinder is "+1.00".

Here's how you transpose (convert) it:

Combine Sphere and Cylinder:
-2.50 (sphere) +1.00 (cylinder) = -1.50

Change cylinder sign:
Cylinder +1.00 becomes -1.00.

Rotate axis by 90 degrees:
Axis 180 becomes axis 90.

Transposed prescription is now:

diff
Copy
Edit
-1.50 -1.00 x90
(Now it's ready for fitting a contact lens.)

Step 2: Vertex Distance (for strong prescriptions)
Vertex distance means the distance from your eye (cornea) to your glasses or testing device.

Usually about 12mm away.

Important rule: If prescription is ±4.00 diopters or stronger, you must adjust for vertex distance.

Why?
Glasses sit away from your eyes. Contact lenses sit directly on your eyes, making them behave differently.

Simplified rule:

When converting glasses prescription to contacts, always make the prescription slightly more PLUS (or "less minus").

Example:

Glasses prescription: -4.00

Contact lens prescription: about -3.75 (more PLUS, less minus)

Bigger prescriptions require bigger adjustments (but not extreme).
For example:

Glasses: -10.00

Contacts: about -9.00

Step 3: Evaluating "K Readings"
"K readings" measure how steep or flat the cornea (front clear surface of your eye) is.

Example: 42.00 / 44.00 @180

This shows the flattest meridian (42.00) and the steepest meridian (44.00) at 180 degrees.

Difference between these numbers shows corneal astigmatism:

Example: 44.00 - 42.00 = 2.00 diopters astigmatism

Corneal vs. Lenticular Astigmatism:

Corneal astigmatism: Astigmatism on your cornea.

Lenticular (internal) astigmatism: Astigmatism inside your eye, from your natural lens.

Important example:
Prescription: -1.00 -3.00 x90 (Total astigmatism = 3.00 diopters)
K readings: 42.00 / 44.00 (Corneal astigmatism = 2.00 diopters)

Cornea has 2.00 diopters astigmatism.

Total astigmatism is 3.00 diopters.

This means: there's 1.00 diopter astigmatism inside your eye (lenticular).

"SAM" and "FAP" Rules (Fitting RGP lenses)
"SAM" = "Steeper Add Minus"

"FAP" = "Flatter Add Plus"

What does it mean?

If the lens is fit "steeper" than K: You must add minus power to your final prescription.

If the lens is fit "flatter" than K: You must add plus power to your final prescription.

Example:

Your final power is -2.00.

If question says "fit 0.50 diopters flatter than K":

Remember FAP: flatter means add plus (+0.50)

Adjusted prescription: -2.00 + 0.50 = -1.50

Gas Permeable (GP) Lenses and Astigmatism
GP lenses are rigid and use tear film behind them to correct astigmatism naturally.

GP lenses can correct:

Up to 3.00 diopters "with-the-rule" astigmatism.

Up to 2.00 diopters "against-the-rule" astigmatism.

"With-the-rule" astigmatism:

Cornea steeper vertically (90° meridian).

Think of a football sitting horizontally on the ground.

"Against-the-rule" astigmatism:

Cornea steeper horizontally (180° meridian).

Football standing upright.

Careful with GP Lens and Hidden Astigmatism!
Sometimes your K reading shows astigmatism but the prescription does NOT.

Example:

K readings: 42.00 / 43.50 (1.50 diopters corneal astigmatism)

Prescription: -2.00 sphere (no astigmatism in the actual prescription)

What this means:

Cornea: has astigmatism.

Lens inside eye: cancels that astigmatism out.

Careful:
If you fit a GP lens on this eye (thinking it corrects astigmatism), you actually CREATE astigmatism because the tear film behind lens fills the gap.

Instead: Fit a soft (HEMA) lens, which drapes gently, avoiding induced astigmatism.

Quick Recap (simple points):
Always convert prescriptions to minus cylinder form.

Adjust for vertex distance if prescription ±4.00 diopters or stronger (make more plus).

Use K readings to find corneal astigmatism and difference from prescription (internal vs. corneal).

Remember SAM (steeper add minus) and FAP (flatter add plus) for RGP lenses.

GP lenses correct up to 3 diopters with-the-rule, 2 diopters against-the-rule astigmatism.

Don't use GP lenses if there's corneal astigmatism that doesn't match the actual prescription—use a soft lens instead.

This should simplify the key points clearly for you!
