🧠 Part 1: Understand the Prescription (Manifest Refraction)
Example Prescription:

Edit
–3.50 –1.25 ×180
This means:

–3.50 = sphere (how nearsighted you are)

–1.25 = cylinder (how much astigmatism)

×180 = axis (where the astigmatism is located)

🟢 Good news: It's already in minus cylinder form, which is what we want for contact lens fitting.

🔁 What if it's not in minus cylinder form?
Say you get:

Copy
Edit
–4.75 +1.25 ×90
That’s plus cylinder form. We need to transpose it.

✏️ How to Transpose:
Add the sphere and cylinder together
–4.75 + 1.25 = –3.50

Change the sign of the cylinder
+1.25 becomes –1.25

Rotate the axis 90°
90 + 90 = 180

✅ New transposed Rx:

–3.50 –1.25 ×180
🧮 Part 2: Vertex Compensation (When & How)
❓What is vertex distance?
It’s the space between the glasses lens and your eyeball — about 12 mm. When you put a contact lens directly on the eye, the power changes slightly.

🚨 When do you compensate?
Only if EITHER meridian is 4.00D or more in power.

Let’s break this Rx down with an optical cross:

You have –3.50 sphere at 180°

And –1.25 cylinder, which applies at 90°

So at:

180° = –3.50

90° = –3.50 –1.25 = –4.75

✅ Since –4.75 is more than 4.00, we need to compensate for vertex distance.

📉 How much do we compensate?
Use this rule of thumb:

Every 5 diopters = change by 0.25 diopter

Always gets less minus (or more plus)

So:

–4.75 → –4.50 (goes up by +0.25)

Now we update the optical cross:

180° = –3.50

90° = –4.50

🧮 How much cylinder now? –3.50 to –4.50 = –1.00

✅ Compensated Rx:

Edit
–3.50 –1.00 ×180
🔍 Part 3: What Do K-Readings Tell You?
K readings = the power of the cornea in two directions
In this example:

graphql
Copy
Edit
43.00 @180 / 44.25 @90
Means:

Flattest curve (least power) = 43.00D at 180°

Steepest curve (most power) = 44.25D at 90°

Difference = 44.25 – 43.00 = 1.25D astigmatism

✅ This matches the refraction’s cylinder (–1.25), so this is corneal astigmatism.

Also:

Steepest at 90° → called with-the-rule astigmatism

👓 Part 4: What Lens Do You Pick?
Options:

Soft toric contact lens

Needed because it must correct for cylinder.

Gas permeable (GP) spherical lens

Works because:

Astigmatism is <3.00D

It’s corneal astigmatism only

GP lenses can “mask” corneal irregularities by floating over them

🧠 Part 5: What if They Say "Steeper Than K" or "Flatter Than K"?
Use this:


Term	Rule
SAM	Steeper → Add Minus
FAP	Flatter → Add Plus
Example:

Final lens: –3.50

They say “fit 0.50D steeper than K”

Steeper = SAM

Add –0.50

✅ New power = –4.00

If they said “flatter than K”, then:

Flatter = FAP

Add +0.50

New power = –3.00

🧾 Final Checklist for NCLE Fitting Questions
Is the Rx in minus cylinder form? If not, transpose.

Do either meridians have 4.00D or more? If so, compensate.

Compare Rx and K-readings:

Does the cylinder match? → Corneal astigmatism

Doesn’t match? → Possibly lenticular astigmatism

What kind of lens to use?

Soft toric → for cylinder

GP sphere → if corneal astigmatism is <3.00D

Did they say steeper or flatter than K?

SAM = Steeper Add Minus

FAP = Flatter Add Plus
