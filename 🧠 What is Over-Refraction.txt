🧠 What is "Over-Refraction"?
Imagine this:

You've given a patient a pair of contact lenses.

They’re wearing them, but they say, “I still can’t see clearly.”

You now need to re-check their vision — with the contacts still in — to see what extra power they might need.

That re-check is called an over-refraction.

👉 It's like putting glasses on top of the contacts to "fine-tune" their vision.

🔢 When It's Simple – Spherical Only
Example:

Patient has a contact lens that’s –3.00.

You over-refract (using the phoropter), and they see better with an extra –0.50.

Answer: Just add it: –3.00 + (–0.50) = –3.50

✅ That means the new lens power should be –3.50.

🔍 But What If There's Cylinder (Astigmatism)?
Now it gets trickier. You can't just add numbers like before.

You need a tool called the Optical Cross. Here's how it works:

📐 What’s an Optical Cross?
It’s just a way to break a prescription into two directions:

180 degrees (horizontal)

90 degrees (vertical)

Each direction can have its own power. This helps with astigmatism.

🧮 Example with Astigmatism:
Let’s say the original prescription (in the contact lens) is: –2.00 –0.50 × 180

➡️ This means:

Power along 180° = –2.00

Power along 90° = –2.00 + (–0.50) = –2.50

Now let’s say during over-refraction, the patient sees better with a –0.50 sphere.

A sphere affects all directions equally, so you add –0.50 to both meridians:

180°: –2.00 + (–0.50) = –2.50

90°: –2.50 + (–0.50) = –3.00

Now, you need to turn these values back into a written prescription:

Start with the less minus (–2.50), that's the sphere.

Find how much more minus the other meridian is: –3.00 – (–2.50) = –0.50 → That’s your cylinder.

The axis stays where the sphere power was: 180

✅ Final Prescription: –2.50 –0.50 × 180

🎯 What’s the Point of All This?
You do over-refraction when:

The patient’s not seeing clearly with their contacts

You want to know what change in power will help — without taking their contacts out

You just:

Take their original lens power

Find the over-refraction (what they see better with on top)

Add it up (use optical cross if it’s not just sphere)

Write the new corrected prescription

🧠 One More Example – Sphero-Cylindrical Over-Refraction
Lens on eye:
–1.00 –1.00 × 180

Over-refraction result:
–1.00 –0.50 × 180

Steps:

Use the optical cross to break both into 180° and 90° meridians.

Add each meridian’s numbers together.

Along 180: –1.00 + (–1.00) = –2.00

Along 90: (–1.00 –1.00) = –2.00 + (–0.50) = –2.50

Now rewrite:

Sphere: –2.00

Cylinder: –0.50

Axis: 180
✅ New lens: –2.00 –0.50 × 180

📏 Bonus: What if You Change the Curve?
If you change the base curve (shape) of the lens, you also change the power:

Steeper = more minus (SAM: Steeper Add Minus)

Flatter = more plus (FAP: Flatter Add Plus)

But if you don’t change the curve, all you're adjusting is the power.
