ðŸ§  PART 1: What is transposition and why do we care?
ðŸŸ¦ What is a glasses or contact lens prescription made of?
It usually looks like this:

diff
Copy
Edit
-2.00 -2.00 x180
That means:

Sphere: -2.00 â†’ This fixes blurry vision (nearsightedness or farsightedness).

Cylinder: -2.00 â†’ This corrects astigmatism (the cornea isnâ€™t perfectly round).

Axis: 180 â†’ This tells us where (which direction) the cylinder goes.

ðŸŸ¨ Why do we need to transpose?
Because contacts always need to be written in minus cylinder form. But doctors sometimes write them in plus cylinder form. So, we need to convert it.

âœ… Transposition Steps (easy version)
Letâ€™s say your prescription is:

diff
Copy
Edit
+1.00 +2.00 x090
Do this:

Add sphere + cylinder:
+1.00 + +2.00 = +3.00

Flip the sign of the cylinder:
+2.00 becomes -2.00

Rotate the axis 90Â°:
090 â†’ 180 (you just subtract or add 90Â°)

New prescription:

diff
Copy
Edit
+3.00 -2.00 x180
Thatâ€™s it. You're done transposing.

ðŸ§  PART 2: Why different meridians (directions) have different power
Think of your eye like a football (not a basketball). Itâ€™s shaped longer in one direction.

One direction is steep â†’ stronger focusing power

One is flat â†’ less power

When you use a sphero-cylindrical lens, different parts of the lens bend light differently. We measure this bending power in different meridians (directions like north-south or east-west).

ðŸŽ¯ The magic power chart: How much of the cylinder is active?
You use this chart to guess the power of the lens at angles between the two main axes:


Distance from Axis	% of Cylinder Used
0Â°	0%
30Â°	25%
45Â°	50%
60Â°	75%
90Â°	100%
Letâ€™s say your RX is:

diff
Copy
Edit
-2.00 -2.00 x180
You want to know: Whatâ€™s the power at axis 150 (which is 30Â° away from 180)?

Step-by-step:
The cylinder is -2.00

30Â° away = 25% of cylinder in play

25% of -2.00 = -0.50

Add that to the sphere:
-2.00 + -0.50 = -2.50

âœ… So, the power at axis 150 is -2.50.

ðŸ§  PART 3: Recognizing astigmatism types
Back to this example:

diff
Copy
Edit
-2.00 -2.00 x180
You transpose it and analyze the power:

On axis 180 (horizontal): -2.00

On axis 90 (vertical): -4.00

So:

One direction is -2.00

Another is -4.00

Both are minus numbers â†’ thatâ€™s called Compound Myopic Astigmatism
(The eye needs minus correction in both directions, but one direction needs more.)

Also:

Strongest power is vertical â†’ Thatâ€™s called With-the-Rule Astigmatism (like how a football sits flat on a table â€” steepest vertically).

ðŸ§ª Sample Test-Style Question:
Q: If youâ€™re given -2.00 -2.00 x180, whatâ€™s the power at axis 135?

Figure out how far axis 135 is from 180 â†’ thatâ€™s 45Â°

45Â° = 50% of cylinder is in play

50% of -2.00 = -1.00

Add to sphere: -2.00 + -1.00 = -3.00

âœ… Final answer: Power at 135 = -3.00

ðŸ§  PART 4: You donâ€™t need to memorize trig â€” just use the chart
Power at axis 148?

Itâ€™s about 30Â° from 180 (close enough).

Use 25% of cylinder â†’ -0.50

Sphere is -2.00
â†’ -2.00 + -0.50 = -2.50

ðŸŽ“ Final Takeaway:
Always write prescriptions for contact lenses in minus cylinder form

Transposition = format conversion (not magic, just 3 steps)

Use the percentage chart to find power at any axis

Youâ€™re not just memorizing â€” youâ€™re learning how the lens bends light differently in different directions
