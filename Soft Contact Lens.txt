 PART 1: What are Soft Contact Lenses, and Why Use Them?
Soft lenses are the most common type of contacts.

They're flexible, sit gently on your eye, and are comfortable right away.

Unlike hard lenses (RGPs), soft lenses don't require a long adjustment period.

They come in one general shape that fits most people. You don’t need to custom-fit the base curve as much.

Most soft lenses are around 14mm wide, which is just right to cover the colored part of your eye (called the iris) and have a little bit extra around it (called a "skirt").

👁️ PART 2: Size of the Eye vs. Lens
The average iris (colored part) is about 12mm wide.

The lens is 14mm, so there’s a 1mm extra on each side — like a blanket hanging off the sides of a bed.

That extra part helps the lens stay in place and not touch sensitive areas like the limbus (the border where your cornea meets the white of your eye).

Why not touch the limbus? Because it has important stem cells. Pressing on it can cause long-term damage like new unwanted blood vessels or cell problems.

 PART 3: HEMA and Silicone Hydrogel
Old soft lenses were made from HEMA (Hydroxyethyl methacrylate). Think of it like soft plastic that holds water.

Today, most lenses are made from silicone hydrogel — it's newer and lets more oxygen reach your eye, which is better for eye health.

 PART 4: What is Spherical Equivalent?
Let’s say you wear glasses with astigmatism correction — that’s when your eye isn’t perfectly round. Glasses fix that using two numbers:

A sphere (main focus)

A cylinder (corrects the astigmatism)

But soft contact lenses don’t always come in astigmatism (toric) versions, especially for low amounts of astigmatism.

So what do we do?

We "average" the prescription to get a single focus power. That’s called a spherical equivalent.

 How to Calculate It:
Spherical Equivalent = Sphere + ½(Cylinder)

 Example:
If your glasses say:
-3.00 -0.50 x180
Take half of -0.50 (that’s -0.25), and add it to -3.00:
-3.25 is the spherical equivalent

But why would you use spherical equivalent?
Because:

Toric lenses (for astigmatism) are more expensive

They don’t always come in colored lenses

They sometimes rotate on your eye, causing blurry vision

If your astigmatism is small (like less than -1.00), skipping it won’t hurt your vision much, and the lens is simpler and more comfortable

 When NOT to Use It
If your astigmatism is more than -1.00, like:

-1.00 or higher for cylinder,
...then don’t do spherical equivalent. You’ll lose too much clarity, and vision will be blurry in parts of your view.

 PART 5: Toric Lenses Are a Bit Weird
Toric lenses (for astigmatism) are:

Heavier at the bottom (prism ballast) so they stay upright

Or have special thinning at the top/bottom to stop spinning (dynamic stabilization)

These features can make them thicker or less comfy

So again, if your cylinder is small (like -0.50), you might skip it and use spherical equivalent to make your life easier.

 Final Rule of Thumb
Only consider spherical equivalent if:

Cylinder is -0.75 or lower

The patient is OK with a small blur difference

Toric options are unavailable, uncomfortable, or too expensive
