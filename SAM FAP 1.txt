🧠 Topic: SAM & FAP (Lens Power Adjustments for NCLE Exam)
🔑 What are SAM and FAP?
These are memory tricks (acronyms) to help you on the NCLE exam when you're adjusting a contact lens prescription:

SAM = Steeper Add Minus

FAP = Flatter Add Plus

You use these when the question says something like:

“Fit the contact lens 0.50 diopters steeper than K.”

You need to know:

If the fit is steeper than K readings → Add Minus (SAM)

If the fit is flatter than K readings → Add Plus (FAP)

K = Keratometry, the corneal curvature readings that tell you how steep or flat the cornea is.

📏 Example K Readings: 42.00 / 43.50 @ 90
These two numbers are your corneal powers.

Lower number = Flatter (42.00)

Higher number = Steeper (43.50)

At axis 90, you’re seeing the steepest point. That means this is with-the-rule astigmatism (steep vertically like a football lying flat).

🧪 Now the Prescription Example:
Given Rx:
-9.00 +1.50 x 90

Step 1: Transpose to minus cylinder form
You always want to work in minus cylinder form for fitting.

Here’s how:

Add the sphere and cylinder:
-9.00 + 1.50 = -7.50

Change the sign of the cylinder:
+1.50 → -1.50

Rotate the axis 90°:
90° → 180°

✅ New Rx (in minus cylinder):
-7.50 -1.50 x 180

👁 Vertex Distance – What is That?
When a patient is refracted, they are looking through lenses about 12–13 mm away from their eye (in the phoropter or glasses).

But contact lenses sit right on the eye.

Because of this change in distance, the actual power needed for the contact lens is different. This difference is called vertex compensation.

🧮 How to Adjust for Vertex Distance
If a prescription is stronger than ±4.00 D, you must adjust it.

Example:
We had -7.50 D from transposition. That's strong enough to need vertex compensation.

You can use a calculator, but on the test you usually estimate.

Here’s the shortcut:

When moving a minus lens closer to the eye (like from glasses to contacts), it becomes less minus

So: -7.50 becomes something like -6.85

Estimate rule of thumb:

-7.50 → becomes -6.85 (due to 13 mm vertex distance)

⬇️ Now Apply SAM or FAP
The question says:

"Fit the lens 0.50 diopters steeper than K"

That's where SAM comes in:

Steeper Add Minus

So now, from the vertex-compensated power -6.85, you add another -0.50 D

Final answer:
-6.85 + (-0.50) = -7.35

So the final lens power to fit = −7.37 D

✅ What if It Said “Flatter Than K”?
That’s FAP:

Flatter Add Plus

So you would add +0.50 to -6.85:

Final answer:
-6.85 + (+0.50) = -6.35 → lens power = −6.37 D

💡 Why Use a Flatter or Steeper Lens?
Steeper lens = tighter fit

Flatter lens = looser fit

Lower base curve = steeper lens

(e.g. 8.3 mm is steeper than 8.7 mm)

So if a patient’s lens is moving too much or too little, you might change base curve or use SAM/FAP to adjust power accordingly.

📌 Summary

Situation	What To Do	Why
Fit is steeper than K	Add minus (SAM)	Steeper = more minus needed
Fit is flatter than K	Add plus (FAP)	Flatter = more plus needed
Rx stronger than ±4.00	Compensate	Contact sits closer than glasses
Always transpose Rx first	Use minus cyl	That’s the format NCLE uses
