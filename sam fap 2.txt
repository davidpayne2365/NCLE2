
🧠 THE CORE IDEA:
When you're fitting gas permeable (GP) lenses, changing the curve of the lens creates optical power you didn't plan for — so you need to cancel it out by adjusting the lens prescription.

👓 Step 1: What is “SAM” and “FAP”?
Think of SAM FAP as your magic rule for fixing power changes caused by curve changes:

S.A.M. = Steeper Add Minus
→ If the lens is steeper than the cornea, add minus power to cancel the extra plus.

F.A.P. = Flatter Add Plus
→ If the lens is flatter than the cornea, add plus to cancel the minus that shows up.

🧪 Why does this happen?
When a GP lens is placed on the eye, it creates a tiny "tear lens" (a layer of tears) between the lens and the cornea.

If the lens is steeper than the cornea, it creates a plus-power tear lens
→ You need to cancel it by adding minus.

If the lens is flatter, the tear lens acts like a minus lens
→ You need to cancel it by adding plus.

🔍 Step 2: What is "Fitting On K"?
K-readings tell us how steep or flat the cornea is.

“Fitting on K” means you choose a lens base curve that matches the flattest K-reading.

If the K-reading is 43.00 @ 180 and 43.75 @ 90, then 43.00 is the flatter curve, so “on K” means using a 43.00 base curve.

🔢 Step 3: The Example
Given:

K-readings: 43.00 @ 180 / 43.75 @ 90 → this is with-the-rule astigmatism (steeper vertically).

Refraction: –4.50 –0.75 × 180

🔁 Step 4: Do We Transpose the Prescription?
Nope! It’s already in minus cylinder form, which is what you want. If it had a plus cylinder, you'd convert it.

📏 Step 5: Vertex Distance
Vertex distance is the space between the phoropter and the eye (~12 mm).

For powers greater than ±4.00, we must adjust the power.

Rule: Contact lenses sit closer to the eye, so:

They need to be less minus / more plus than glasses.

–4.50 becomes –4.25 when adjusted for vertex distance.

🧮 Step 6: Apply SAM or FAP
Let’s say we’re NOT fitting on K. We change the base curve:

📉 If fitting flatter than K (e.g., by 0.50D):
Use F.A.P. = Flatter Add Plus

Start with –4.25

Add +0.50
→ Final power: –3.75

📈 If fitting steeper than K (e.g., by 0.50D):
Use S.A.M. = Steeper Add Minus

Start with –4.25

Add –0.50
→ Final power: –4.75

🎯 Bonus Teaching Points
The K-reading difference of 0.75D tells us the patient has corneal astigmatism.

Since the refraction matches the corneal astigmatism, there’s no lenticular astigmatism (it’s all from the cornea).

With-the-rule astigmatism (steeper vertically) is correctable with spherical GP lenses up to 3.00D.
