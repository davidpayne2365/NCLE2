🧠 Topic: Front Surface Toric RGP Contact Lenses
(“RGP” = Rigid Gas Permeable)

1. 🥽 What is a Front Surface Toric RGP Lens?
Think of an RGP lens like a tiny hard piece of plastic that sits on the eye and helps correct your vision.

“Toric” just means it corrects for astigmatism.

“Front surface” means the cylinder power (the part that fixes astigmatism) is added to the front of the lens.

The back of the lens (the part touching the eye) is spherical (same curve all around).

🟡 WHY use it? When the patient has astigmatism in their vision prescription, but not on their cornea.

2. 👀 How Do We Know if It’s the Right Lens?
You start by looking at two things:

Glasses prescription (manifest refraction)

K-readings (corneal shape/power)

3. 🧾 Step-by-Step Breakdown:
A. Start with the glasses prescription
Let’s say the Rx is:

diff
Copy
Edit
-2.50 -1.50 x 180
That’s already in minus cylinder form — good!

If it were in plus cylinder, you’d need to transpose it:

Add the sphere and cylinder

Flip the sign of the cylinder

Rotate the axis by 90°

B. Check vertex distance
If the power is over ±4.00D, you might need to adjust it a bit.

Example: -4.00 glasses Rx becomes around -3.87 when on the eye.

Why? Because lenses behave differently depending on how far they are from the eye.

C. Look at K-readings
K-readings measure how curved the cornea is.

Example: K = 44/44 → no astigmatism on the cornea.

K = 42/44 → 2 diopters of corneal astigmatism.

4. 🧪 Compare Prescription and K-Readings
Let’s say:

Prescription: -2.50 -1.50 x180 (this person needs astigmatism correction)

K-readings: 44/44 → no corneal astigmatism

So the question is: Where is the astigmatism coming from if not the cornea?

Answer: It’s probably lenticular astigmatism (from inside the eye)

That’s when a Front Surface Toric RGP is helpful.

5. 🧱 Base Curve vs. Front Toric
Base curve = the back curve of the lens (touches the eye)

In a front toric lens:

Back = round (spherical)

Front = has cylinder added

That way it sits comfortably without adding astigmatism to the cornea — it just corrects what’s missing in the vision.

6. ❌ When Not to Use RGPs
If:

The cornea has astigmatism, but

The vision prescription is spherical (no astigmatism),

…then a spherical RGP might induce astigmatism by accident. Bad match.

✅ Instead, use a soft lens (HEMA or silicone hydrogel), which just drapes over the eye and doesn’t mess with the corneal shape.

7. 🧠 When Are Front Toric RGPs Best?
Use them when:

The patient has over 1.25D of astigmatism in their prescription

But their K-readings show no corneal astigmatism

Otherwise, it’s often better to just use a spherical RGP or soft lens.

8. 🔺 Bonus: Prism Ballast
Front toric RGPs must stay in place, so:

They include 1.5 prism diopters base-down.

This helps them rotate correctly and stay aligned.

Often marked at 6 o'clock with a dot for orientation.

📝 Summary Checklist (for NCLE):
✅ Always convert Rx to minus cylinder form
✅ Check if vertex compensation is needed (if Rx > ±4.00)
✅ Compare Rx vs. K-readings
✅ If Rx has cylinder but K-readings don’t, think Front Toric RGP
✅ Front toric = spherical back, cylinder on front
✅ Add prism ballast for stabilization
✅ Use when astigmatism is lenticular, not corneal
