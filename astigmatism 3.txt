🧠 First, What’s Astigmatism?
Your eye is like a camera.

In a perfect eye, light focuses at one clean point on the back of the eye (the retina).

With astigmatism, light focuses in two different spots — like a blurry photo.

Why? Because your cornea (front of the eye) is shaped more like a football than a basketball.

We fix it by measuring the steep and flat parts — called the two main meridians.

🔍 What Are These Weird Astigmatism Names?
All these “simple” and “compound” names just tell you where the light focuses in those two main directions (meridians).

1. 🟥 Simple Myopic Astigmatism
Myopia = Nearsighted = Light focuses in front of the retina.

In simple myopic, one meridian focuses in front, one is perfect (on the retina).

Example:
-1.00 +1.00 x 180 → Transpose = Plano -1.00 x 90
→ One meridian is 0, the other is -1 → that’s simple myopic.

2. 🟥 Compound Myopic Astigmatism
Both meridians focus in front of the retina.

Example:
-0.25 -0.25 x 90 → Already in minus cylinder → both meridians are minus
→ That’s compound myopic.

3. 🟩 Simple Hyperopic Astigmatism
Hyperopia = Farsighted = Light focuses behind the retina.

In simple hyperopic, one meridian is perfect, one is too far (behind the retina).

Example:
+2.00 -2.00 x 180 → Transpose = Plano +2.00 x 90
→ One meridian is 0, the other is +2 → simple hyperopic.

4. 🟩 Compound Hyperopic Astigmatism
Both meridians focus behind the retina.

Example:
+0.75 +0.75 x 180 → Transpose = +1.50 -0.75 x 90
→ Both meridians are + → compound hyperopic.

5. 🟪 Mixed Astigmatism
One meridian is nearsighted (−), the other is farsighted (+).

They’re focusing on opposite sides of the retina.

Example:
-1.00 +2.00 x 90 → Transpose = +1.00 -2.00 x 180
→ One is +1.00, one is −1.00 → mixed astigmatism.

🔁 BONUS: How to Classify "With the Rule" vs "Against the Rule"
Imagine a football:

With the Rule (WTR) = Steeper up-and-down (90°), flatter side-to-side (180°)
→ Like a football lying down.

Against the Rule (ATR) = Steeper side-to-side (180°), flatter up-and-down (90°)
→ Like a football standing on end.

How do you know?
Look at which meridian has more minus power.

If 90° has more minus → With the Rule

If 180° has more minus → Against the Rule

🧪 Quick Formula Recap (Transpose Practice)
When you're given a prescription and need to classify it, here’s what you do:

Transpose it (if it's not already in minus cylinder form):

Add Sphere + Cylinder = new Sphere

Flip the sign of the Cylinder

Change the Axis by 90°

Compare the two meridians:

One zero, one minus → Simple Myopic

One zero, one plus → Simple Hyperopic

Both minus → Compound Myopic

Both plus → Compound Hyperopic

One plus, one minus → Mixed

🧠 Summary You Can Memorize:

Name	Sphere Signs After Transpose
Simple Myopic	0 and −
Compound Myopic	− and −
Simple Hyperopic	0 and +
Compound Hyperopic	+ and +
Mixed Astigmatism	− and + (or + and −)
