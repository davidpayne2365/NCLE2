🧠 STEP 1: Understand Key Terms First
✅ K Readings (Keratometry)
These measure how steep or flat the front of the eye (the cornea) is.

Example: 42/44 @ 90 means one part of the eye is 42 (flatter), and another is 44 (steeper).

The difference between them = corneal astigmatism.

✅ Refraction (the glasses prescription)
Example: -1.00 -2.00 x180

This says the person is nearsighted (-1.00) and has -2.00 of cylinder, which is the total astigmatism they experience.

✅ Astigmatism
When the eye is shaped more like a football than a basketball.

It can come from:

The cornea (front of the eye — what the K readings measure).

Or the lens inside the eye (called lenticular or residual astigmatism).

👓 STEP 2: What are the 4 Types of RGP Lenses?
1. Spherical RGP Lens
It’s smooth, like a marble — no curve changes.

Use it when:

Corneal astigmatism (K readings difference) ≈ Refraction astigmatism (Rx cylinder).

Example: K = 42/44 (2D), Rx = -1.00 -2.00 x180 → ✅ Use spherical lens.

💡 Why does it work?
The lens + your tears fill in the uneven cornea and make a smooth surface.

2. Front Surface Toric (FST) Lens
The toric (curved) part is on the front of the lens.

Use it when:

Very little corneal astigmatism (less than 1D from K readings),

But lots of astigmatism in the Rx → means it's coming from inside the eye.

💡 Example:
K = 42/42.50 → very small corneal astigmatism
Rx = -1.00 -2.00 x90 → 2D total astigmatism
✅ That mismatch means you need a Front Toric.

⚠️ Needs prism ballast to stay upright — like a little weight so it doesn’t spin.

3. Back Surface Toric (BST) Lens
The toric part is on the back of the lens, the part touching the eye.

Use it when:

Corneal astigmatism is about 2/3 of total astigmatism.

Example: 4D corneal / 6D total = 2/3 match → ✅ Back Toric

💡 Why?
The back of the lens is shaped to match the uneven cornea directly.

🧮 You may need to compensate for vertex distance (adjust Rx numbers when converting from glasses to contacts).

4. Bi-Toric Lens
Curved on both front AND back.

Use it when:

There’s lots of corneal astigmatism (like 4D or more),

And the 2/3 rule doesn’t apply.

Basically: when none of the other 3 lenses are working.

💡 Example:
K = 42/47 = 5D corneal
Rx = -1.00 -6.00 x180 = 5D after vertex compensation
Doesn't match any neat rule → ✅ Use a Bi-Toric

📊 RECAP CHEAT SHEET

Lens Type	When to Use
Spherical	Corneal astigmatism ≈ Rx cylinder (match!)
Front Toric	Corneal astigmatism < 1D, Rx has ≥ 1D → mismatch = lenticular
Back Toric	Corneal astigmatism ≈ ⅔ of total Rx cylinder
Bi-Toric	High corneal astigmatism + no ⅔ match = need correction on both sides
😵 Still confused? Think of this:
Imagine you're trying to cover a weirdly shaped hill with a blanket (the contact lens).
Depending on how lumpy the hill is (cornea) and how much the person sees as blurry (Rx), you decide what kind of blanket works:

Normal smooth blanket (spherical),

Blanket with curves on top (front toric),

Blanket with curves underneath (back toric),

Or one that’s curved on both sides (bi-toric).
