🧠 What is Lens Rotation?
When a toric contact lens is put on the eye to fix astigmatism, it can rotate slightly once it’s on the eye.
Think of it like this: you put glasses on, but they shift a little to the side. Now you're not seeing correctly.
Same thing with the lens—rotation messes up the axis, which is a key part of the prescription.

🔧 What’s the Problem?
The axis in a toric lens (like 180, 90, etc.) tells the lens where to fix the blur from astigmatism.
If the lens rotates, the axis is wrong now—your correction is no longer in the right place.
So we need to adjust the prescription based on how much the lens rotated.

🧩 The Easy Trick to Remember: LARS
Left = Add degrees to the axis

Right = Subtract degrees from the axis

This tells you what to do with the axis based on how the lens rotated on the eye.

🕰️ Wait, which way is left or right?
This is where it gets a little confusing:

If the lens turns clockwise, that’s to the left (so you add).

If it turns counterclockwise, that’s to the right (so you subtract).

Yes, that sounds backwards—but that’s just how it’s described from the doctor’s point of view, looking at your eye.

🧮 Example 1:
Original Rx: -3.00 -1.75 ×180
Observation: Lens rotated 20° to the right (counterclockwise)

Using LARS:

Right = Subtract

180 - 20 = 160

✅ New Rx: -3.00 -1.75 ×160

🧮 Example 2:
Original Rx: -3.00 -1.75 ×180
Observation: Lens rotated 30° to the left (clockwise)

Using LARS:

Left = Add

But you’re at 180, so treat it like 0, and add 30

✅ New Rx: -3.00 -1.75 ×30

🧷 What helps lenses not rotate?
Lenses can be designed to stay in place better using:

Prism ballast – adds thickness to the bottom of the lens

Peri-ballast

Truncation – flattens the bottom edge

Know those names for the NCLE exam, even if you don’t need to do math with them.

📘 Key Takeaways
Toric lenses must stay in place to work right.

If they rotate, LARS helps fix the axis:

Left (clockwise) → Add

Right (counterclockwise) → Subtract

Be careful: The test might say “clockwise” or “counterclockwise”, not left or right, to trip you up.
