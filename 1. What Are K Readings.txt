1. What Are K Readings?
Think of "K readings" as cornea measurements.
They tell us how curved your cornea is, and whether there's astigmatism (a condition causing blurry vision).

Cornea = Clear dome-shaped surface at the front of your eye.

2. How Do We Get K Readings?
We use a machine called a "keratometer."
It measures how powerful (curved) different parts of your cornea are.

Cornea normally provides about +43 "units" (diopters) of focusing power.
We measure variations from this number to spot astigmatism.

3. What Do the Numbers Mean?
K readings look like this:
"44.00 / 46.00 @180" or "43.50 @90 / 43.50 @180".

Numbers (like 44.00, 46.00) = Cornea's power at certain angles (meridians).

"@" followed by a number (e.g., @180, @90) means the angle/direction where we measured.

Higher number = steeper (more curved) cornea.

Lower number = flatter (less curved) cornea.

4. How Do You Spot Astigmatism from K Readings?
No Astigmatism (perfectly round cornea):
K readings are identical, for example:

43.50 @90 and 43.50 @180 (same number everywhere).

Astigmatism (uneven cornea shape):
K readings are different, for example:

44.00 @180 and 46.00 @90 (two different numbers).

This means one direction (meridian) is flatter and one is steeper.

5. Types of Astigmatism:
We name astigmatism by which direction (angle) is steeper:

With-the-rule:
Vertical direction (90°) is steeper.

Example: 44.00 horizontally, 46.00 vertically (@90).
(Most common type.)

Against-the-rule:
Horizontal direction (180°) is steeper.

Example: 46.00 horizontally (@180), 44.00 vertically.

Oblique (diagonal):
Steepest direction is at odd angles (not close to 90° or 180°).

Example: steepest curve at 45° or 135° angles.

6. Real-life Example Clearly Explained:
Example K reading:

44.00 @180 / 46.00 @90

This shows:

Steeper vertically (46.00)

Flatter horizontally (44.00)

This is called "with-the-rule" astigmatism (vertical is steeper).

Difference (46.00 - 44.00) = 2 diopters of astigmatism.
(Means there’s significant astigmatism present.)

7. Corneal vs. Lenticular Astigmatism:
Sometimes the cornea (front of eye) isn't the only source of astigmatism.

You also have an internal lens ("crystalline lens") behind the cornea. It can also cause astigmatism—called "lenticular astigmatism."

If a patient's glasses prescription shows more astigmatism than the K readings suggest, it's because the internal lens is adding more astigmatism.

Lenticular astigmatism can happen if the lens is displaced (called "subluxation").

Simple Summary:
K readings measure your cornea’s curvature.

Different numbers = astigmatism.

Steeper vertical = "with-the-rule" (most common).

Steeper horizontal = "against-the-rule."

Astigmatism can come from cornea or lens inside your eye.
